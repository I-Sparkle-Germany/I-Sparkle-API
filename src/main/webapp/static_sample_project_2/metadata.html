Most items are completed in pairs, but one item allows for individual completion.<br><br>\n\nSome suggestions from teachers who have run the project:<br><br>\n<ul><li>Step 2.4: A classroom discussion with the map will help students focus on the important parts of the map.\n<li>Step 4.8: The simulation may take a while to load depending on the computer/network speed, and there may be several seconds with a blank screen before the active loading screen appears, so students may think there is something wrong. Also, it may take a while for the molecules to come back together in the simulation after clicking \"remove cup of hot water,\" so ask students to be patient.</li></ul>",
